## Context

The current Django application uses a traditional app structure where all functionality is organized under `apps/`. This approach works well for monolithic applications but limits modularity and makes it difficult to add/remove features independently. The todo_tasks app currently provides comprehensive task management functionality that could serve as a template for a plugin-based architecture.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Create a modular plugin system that allows independent feature development
- Move todo_tasks functionality to a plugin as a proof of concept
- Establish patterns for future plugin development
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing todo functionality
- Enable plugin discovery and configuration management

**Non-Goals:**
- Complete re-architecture of the entire application
- Plugin marketplace or external plugin support
- Dynamic plugin loading/unloading without server restart
- Breaking existing todo functionality during transition

## Decisions

### Decision: Plugin Directory Structure
**Chosen**: `/plugins/[feature-name]/` with self-contained Django app structure
**Why**:
- Familiar Django app patterns for developers
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to migrate existing apps to plugins
- Standard Django tooling works out of the box

**Alternatives considered**:
- `/plugins/[vendor]/[feature]/` - Overly complex for internal development
- Single file plugin modules - Too restrictive for complex features

### Decision: Plugin Registration Method
**Chosen**: Django settings with plugin-specific configuration
**Why**:
- Leverages existing Django mechanisms
- Easy to enable/disable plugins
- Configuration stays with other Django settings
- No additional runtime discovery needed

**Alternatives considered**:
- Auto-discovery from `/plugins/` directory - Could be unpredictable
- External plugin registry files - Adds complexity

### Decision: URL Routing
**Chosen**: Dynamic URL inclusion from enabled plugins
**Why**:
- Plugins control their own URL patterns
- Central URL configuration remains clean
- Easy to add/remove plugin URLs
- Supports URL namespacing

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual URL registration per plugin - More maintenance overhead
- Separate URL files per plugin - Redundant with Django app patterns

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Risk: Increased Complexity
- **Risk**: Plugin system adds abstraction layers that may confuse developers
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation and clear examples
- **Trade-off**: Accept small complexity increase for significant modularity gains

### Risk: Performance Overhead
- **Risk**: Dynamic plugin loading may impact startup time
- **Mitigation**: Minimal overhead with Django settings-based approach
- **Trade-off**: Negligible performance impact for development flexibility

### Risk: Migration Complexity
- **Risk**: Moving todo_tasks may break existing functionality
- **Mitigation**: Careful data migration plan and backward compatibility
- **Trade-off**: Short-term migration pain for long-term architectural benefits

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Plugin Infrastructure
1. Create base plugin classes and utilities
2. Implement plugin discovery mechanism
3. Add plugin configuration to settings
4. Test plugin system with minimal test plugin

### Phase 2: Todo Plugin Migration
1. Copy todo_tasks code to plugins/todo/
2. Update imports and app configuration
3. Create data migration from todo_tasks tables
4. Update URL routing for plugin URLs
5. Test all todo functionality through plugin interface

### Phase 3: Cleanup
1. Remove original apps/todo_tasks/
2. Update documentation
3. Verify all tests pass
4. Deploy plugin-based architecture

### Rollback Plan
- Keep original todo_tasks code until migration is verified
- Database migrations can be rolled back if needed
- URL routing can be reverted with simple settings changes
- All changes are contained within Django app structure

## Open Questions

- Should plugins have their own database schemas or share the main database?
- How should plugin static files be handled?
- Should there be plugin-specific settings management?
- How to handle plugin dependencies and versioning?
- Should plugins be able to override core application functionality?
