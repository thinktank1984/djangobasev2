# Document PGQ-Cmd Integration Proposal

## Summary

This proposal integrates the existing `pgq-cmd` PostgreSQL-based task scheduler documentation into the project's OpenSpec system. The `pgq-cmd` is a comprehensive, self-contained scheduler implementation that provides automated task scheduling with embedded PostgreSQL, virtual environments, and advanced logging capabilities.

## Current State

The file `documentation/pgq-cmd.tasks.queue.md` contains a complete, well-documented implementation of a PostgreSQL-based task scheduler with the following features:

- **Self-contained**: No external PostgreSQL needed (embedded setup)
- **Auto-setup**: Virtual environment and schema creation
- **Advanced logging**: Pipeline logging with JSON configuration
- **Task naming**: Optional user-defined or auto-generated names
- **Fan-out scheduling**: `--array-json` support for scheduling multiple tasks
- **Process isolation**: Separate processes per job
- **Live dashboard**: Built-in monitoring capabilities

## Proposed Changes

This proposal aims to:

1. **Formalize the documentation** within the OpenSpec system
2. **Create requirements** for the pgq-cmd integration
3. **Define implementation tasks** for proper documentation integration
4. **Ensure the documentation** aligns with project conventions
5. **Provide validation** that the documentation is complete and accurate

## Impact

- **Documentation**: Improves discoverability and organization of task scheduling capabilities
- **Development**: Provides clear reference for implementing task scheduling features
- **Maintenance**: Ensures documentation is versioned and tracked with the project
