# PGQ-Cmd Documentation Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Document PGQ-Cmd Integration
- **Description**: The project SHALL include comprehensive documentation for the pgq-cmd PostgreSQL-based task scheduler, ensuring it is properly integrated into the OpenSpec system and easily discoverable by developers.

#### Scenario: Developer discovers task scheduling capabilities
- **Given** A developer is exploring the project documentation
- **When** They search for task scheduling or job queue solutions
- **Then** They should find the pgq-cmd documentation through the OpenSpec system
- **And** The documentation should be properly structured and versioned

### Requirement: Document Self-Contained Scheduler Features
- **Description**: The documentation SHALL clearly describe all features of the pgq-cmd self-contained scheduler implementation.

#### Scenario: Developer evaluates pgq-cmd for project use
- **Given** A developer is reading the pgq-cmd documentation
- **When** They want to understand the scheduler's capabilities
- **Then** They should find clear descriptions of:
  - Embedded PostgreSQL setup
  - Automatic virtual environment creation
  - JSON configuration-driven logging
  - Task naming conventions
  - Array-based fan-out scheduling
  - Process isolation per job
  - Live dashboard capabilities

### Requirement: Document Installation and Setup Process
- **Description**: The documentation SHALL provide clear, step-by-step instructions for setting up and using the pgq-cmd scheduler.

#### Scenario: Developer sets up pgq-cmd for the first time
- **Given** A developer wants to use the pgq-cmd scheduler
- **When** They follow the documentation instructions
- **Then** They should be able to:
  - Save the pgq-cmd file correctly
  - Make it executable
  - Start the worker process
  - Schedule their first task
  - View task logs

### Requirement: Document Usage Examples and Patterns
- **Description**: The documentation SHALL include comprehensive usage examples covering common scheduling patterns and advanced features.

#### Scenario: Developer implements different scheduling patterns
- **Given** A developer needs to implement task scheduling
- **When** They review the usage examples
- **Then** They should find examples for:
  - Simple recurring tasks
  - Fan-out scheduling with JSON arrays
  - One-off task enqueueing
  - Task listing and monitoring
  - Log configuration and access

### Requirement: Document Configuration Options
- **Description**: The documentation SHALL clearly explain all configuration options available through the JSON config system.

#### Scenario: Developer customizes pgq-cmd behavior
- **Given** A developer wants to customize the scheduler configuration
- **When** They examine the configuration documentation
- **Then** They should understand how to configure:
  - Log directory paths
  - Pipeline logging commands
  - PostgreSQL port settings
  - Any other available configuration options

### Requirement: Document Integration with Project Conventions
- **Description**: The pgq-cmd documentation SHALL be aligned with project documentation conventions and integrated into the broader project documentation structure.

#### Scenario: Developer navigates project documentation
- **Given** A developer is browsing project documentation
- **When** They look for task scheduling solutions
- **Then** The pgq-cmd documentation should:
  - Follow project formatting conventions
  - Be linked from relevant documentation sections
  - Include cross-references to related capabilities
  - Maintain consistency with other documentation

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Documentation Organization
- **Description**: The project documentation structure SHALL accommodate the pgq-cmd scheduler documentation while maintaining logical organization.

#### Scenario: Developer finds task scheduling documentation
- **Given** The project documentation includes pgq-cmd integration
- **When** A developer searches for task scheduling information
- **Then** They should be able to locate the documentation through:
  - The main documentation index
  - Search functionality
  - Cross-references from related topics
  - Logical categorization under development tools
